## Overview
****
This project is an intelligent Book Recommendation System built with Python (Flask) and powered by XGBoost, designed to personalize book suggestions based on user behavior and reading patterns.

Users interact with the system by viewing, clicking, favoriting, or purchasing books. These interactions are stored and used to train a machine learning model (XGBoost) that predicts and recommends books tailored to each userâ€™s preferences.
